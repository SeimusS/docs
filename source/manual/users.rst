==================================
Access / User Management
==================================

   :width: 100%

The user manager of OPNsense allows for controlling access to the different
part (pages) of the configurator as well as controlling access to particular
services on a per user bases.

Authentication
--------------
OPNsense offers integration with external servers for services that require user
authentication. These services include:

* IPsec
* OpenVPN
* Captive Portal
* Proxy

Integrated into OPNsense are the **Local User Database** and **Voucher Server**.
The Voucher Server is intended to be used with the Captive portal.

External services currently supported are:

* LDAP (OpenLDAP, MS Active Directory, Novell eDirectory)
* Radius

Authorization
-------------
Besides authenticating, user authorization to access parts of the configuration
can also be setup with an external server, but in order to grant the appropriate
privileges to the users they need to exist in OPNsense's local user manager.
This way one can validate a user against its externally stored password and have
a fine grained control over the configuration pages that user may access.

.. Note::

   When creating administration users with a configured shell, their naming scheme's are more strict (max 33 characters of a limited set).
   All other usernames are more flexible as no local shell accounts will be created.



Users, Groups & Privileges
--------------------------
When using the local user manager, either stand alone or on combination with an
external authentication server one can define groups to combine a set of privileges
for a specific user group. A user should be an individual, a group needs to be
specific in such a way that anyone of that group can be granted the same access
rights, called privileges.

.. Note::

    It's not always required to have users in your local database, when the remote server
    should merely answer the question if a user offers a valid user/password combination,
    most services can just push this question to the authenticating server. Constraints
    in some cases can be part of the authenticator as well. When the user should login
    to the firewall (for example to change settings or download a profile), a local user
    is always required as it serves as a linking pin to the ACL system.


Authentication services
----------------------------------

Authentication services can be configured using the settings in :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Servers`.
This includes both local accounts and remote authentication.

By default, OPNsense GUI login will use local accounts. This can be changed, however,
by going to :menuselection:`System --> Settings --> Administration`, scrolling down to the "Authentication" group,
and changing the 'Server' option.

.. Tip::

   The authentication part always uses a local "anchor" (user in the local database) to account for access rights,
   some remote servers are able to supply the required information by communicating the groups a user is member of after authentication.


Local account configuration
---------------------------

Settings for handling login via local accounts can be set by going to :menuselection:`System --> Access --> Servers`,
then clicking the 'Edit' icon (a pencil) for 'Local Database'. Here, you can improve security of
local user accounts by setting password length and complexity constraints.

An overview of available settings:

=====================================  =============================================================================================================
 **Policy**                            Enable password policy constraints.
 **Duration**                          [Policy] Password duration, optionally define how often the user should change his or her password.
 **Length**                            [Policy] Minimum password length to require.
 **Complexity**                        [Policy] Enforce password complexity checks.
 **Compliance**                        [Policy] Require SHA-512 password hashing instead of Blowfish
=====================================  =============================================================================================================


.. Tip::

   When using One Time Passwords in combination with the local database, the same policy constraints apply as configured in "Local Database".


.. Note::

   Our default Blowfish is not part of AES and is not considered compliant with any Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
   Although more secure than SHA-512, its use may not be permitted in some environments.



Configuration
-------------


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :titlesonly:

   how-tos/user-local
   how-tos/user-ldap
   how-tos/user-radius
   two_factor


.. Note::

    When using external authentication services (such as ldap), the firewall needs a route to the configured target machine
    in order to function properly. Specifically when the server is only reachable over a classic IPsec tunnel (non VTI),
    a static route might be needed to guide the packets into the right tunnel matching the policy. (for example
    when a policy for LAN exists, add a gateway pointing to our own address and a static routing pusing traffic to the
    other end).

    A quick test if the routes are properly setup can always be performed using ping from the :code:`default` source address.
